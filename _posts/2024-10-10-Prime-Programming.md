## Summary

*Write a function that returns prime numbers, 2 through n…* is a level
two programming problem. Beyond simple looping and conditional
functions, it requires some understanding of control flow, basic
algorithms, and optimization.

Although I’m not the first to demonstrate this problem, the demo here serves as a benchmark in my beginning programming
journey. Honestly, this problem gave me a headache for weeks. When I did
figure it out, I learned that my “simple” method was inefficient in
terms of computing time. The optimal method - the Sieve of
Eratosthenes - was introduced over 2000 years ago. In this demo, we’ll
take a look at both.

As a long-time R user who is now getting used to Python, I thought it
would be fun to demo this problem in both languages to compare code and
processing speed.

### Start simple

A prime number is any number divisible (wholly) only by itself and one.
The number one does not count; a prime must have two unique divisors. A
list of prime numbers between 2 and 20 includes: \[2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13,
17, 19\].

Each number in the returned set is proven to be a prime by dividing
every number *i* in that set by every number lower than *i* (starting with 2) and not getting
a whole number. For example, 5 divided by neither 2, 3, nor 4, produces a whole number.

But, we do not need to divide by *every* lower number: we only need to check divisors up to the square
root of *i*, because any larger divisor would already have a
corresponding lower divisor.

So, we can test if a number *i* is a prime by dividing it by every whole
number in the range 2:sqrt(*i*). Great, and we have to do that for every
number in the range 2 through n.  
Then, we just have to return a list of each prime number in the set. Sounds
simple?!

This means our function has to:

1.  loop through each i in 2 through n,
2.  divide each i by 2 through the square root of i,
3.  until either a) a whole number is found (not a prime), or b) a whole
    number is not found (prime)
4.  and populate a new list when condition 3b is met using the i for
    which that condition was met.

Ok? lets go…

``` r
# First, a function that will test if a number is a prime by dividing it from the set [i in 2:sqrt(i)]

is_prime <- function(n) {
    if (n<2) return(FALSE)
    if (n==2) return(TRUE) # 2 is not a prime, but the function won't work on 2 unless we explicitly name it.
        for (i in 2:sqrt(n)) {
            if (n %% i == 0) return(FALSE) # In R, %% returns a remainder after dividing. So basically were asking it rule out non-whole numbers after dividing     each i through the sequence 2 through sqrt(n) 
    }
    return(TRUE)
}

# Second, apply the is_prime() test to each i in 2:n. 
r_primes<-function(n) {
    primes<-NULL # initializing a an empty array that will be appended whenever a prime is found.
    for (i in 2:n) {
        if(is_prime(i)) {
            primes<-c(primes,i)
        }
    }
    print(paste("There are", length(primes), "prime numbers between 2 and", n))
    
    if (length(primes) < 170) {print(primes)}
    
}

r_primes(1000)
```

    if len(p_set) < 170:
        print(f"Primes:", sorted(p_set)) # This is the only way to I know to print the primes in a legible way

py_primes(1000)
```

### Sieve Method

The code above works, it appears efficient, it is legible in both R and
Python, and as a beginner programmer I’m happy I solved the problem. In
hindsight, however, the code is not optimal. We’re asking it to loop
through every number in our original set (2 through n) and divide each
by another set of numbers (2:sqrt(n)). That’s easy for small sets like
1-20, but when n gets large, it takes considerable computing time. A
human looking at the set 1-20 does not need to go through and test every
number. We know, for example, that even numbers are not prime numbers
because they are divisible by 2 (in addition to 1 and n itself) by
definition, so we don’t bother to test them. We also know that multiples
of 5 (except five itself) are not primes either, because we learn to
count by fives as kids, and so we can eliminate those from our task as
well. In other words, instead of dividing, we simplify the problem by
eliminating multiples. It’s easy for a human to return primes 1-20
because we minimize the number of tests that we need to make. We can
turn the problem requiring about 60 calculations into one that requires
about 4. In fact, for any given set 1:n, we don’t have to loop n times
to figure out which numbers are primes. We can use the fact that our
divisor becomes redunant by the time we get to the square root of n. We
only need to eliminate multiples up to the square root of n! For example
in the set 1-100, we can eliminate all even numbers, all multiples of
3s, 5s, 7s, and… thats its, we’re done! 4, 6, 8, 9, and 10 have already
been eliminated.

As a beginning programmer, it was a cool realization that, while
computers are super fast, they are only as efficient as they are
programmed to be.

In R, the Sieve of Eratosthenes looks like:

``` r
sieve_primes <- function(n) {
    primes <- rep(TRUE, n) # A boolean vector in which the index of the true values will represent the prime numbers!
    primes[1] <- FALSE  # 1 (which is also primes index 1) is not prime. 
    
    for (i in 2:sqrt(n)) { # We only have to loop through up to the square root
        if (primes[i] == TRUE) {  # If i is prime
            primes[seq(i^2, n, i)] <- FALSE  # start eliminating multiples with i^2 because smaller multiples of i have already been eliminated by smaller primes. 
        }
    }
    
    print(paste("There are", sum(primes), "prime numbers between 2 and", n))
    
    if (sum(primes) < 170) {print(which(primes))}
}

sieve_primes(1000)
```

### Time test

But how much better is one method than the other, and which language is
better for the task? When finding Primes within 1000, both methods in
both languages are performed in the blink of an eye. But when n gets
large, we start to see real differences. We can use the timer functions
in each langauge to compare.

#### Simple R Method

``` r
system.time(r_primes(1000000))
```

    ## [1] "There are 78498 prime numbers between 2 and 1e+06"

    ##    user  system elapsed 
    ##   14.48    0.95   16.11

#### Simple Python Method

``` python
import timeit

t = timeit.Timer(lambda: py_primes(1000000))
execution_time = t.timeit(number = 1)
```

    ## There are 78498 prime numbers between 2 and 1000000.

``` python
print(f"Execution time: {execution_time} seconds")
```

    ## Execution time: 3.9025774000037927 seconds

#### Sieve in R

``` r
system.time(sieve_primes(1000000))
```

    ## [1] "There are 78498 prime numbers between 2 and 1e+06"

    ##    user  system elapsed 
    ##    0.25    0.07    0.30

#### Sieve in Python

``` python
t = timeit.Timer(lambda: sieve_of_eratosthenes(1000000))
execution_time = t.timeit(number = 1)
```

    ## There are 78498 prime numbers between 2 and 1000000.

``` python
print(f"Execution time: {execution_time} seconds")
```

    ## Execution time: 0.05590980000124546 seconds

### Conclusion

While Python performs faster than R in both cases, the differences are
negligible for practical purposes, especially from this beginner
programmer’s perspective. The real takeaways are that optimal code,
especially for complex tasks, is always the goal, and that while
computers are fast can only think as efficiently as the code we write.
